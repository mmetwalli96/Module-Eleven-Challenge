## Summary
---
One draw back of the design of this webpage is the need to have an exact search words to match the existing data in the table, this makes difficult espicially if the user doesn't recall the exact information in the table. 

Recomendations for further development are as follows:
- Adding the duration as filter. 
- Addressing the previously mentioned drawback by enable soft match instead of exact match of the search words, to display the search results.
